## Features

- Generate passwords with customizable options
- User-friendly GTK-4 interface
- Adjustable password length
- Options to include:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- GTK-4 development libraries

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo build` to compile the project
3. Execute `cargo run` to start the application

## Usage
